    "For my project I initially wanted to code a program that would help me make decisions while regarding baking. With all the baking I am doing while in quarantine, I managed to pinpoint some of the larger problems that arise, such as determining weight and changing serving sizes. I found that the weight of ingredients differs according to what it is, which can be confusing at times. To prevent me from again adding 40 grams of butter instead of 120 grams for a craquelin choux crust, I decided on a weight convertor to change weights. I only have a scale at home, makes it difficult for situations like when a recipe calls for a cup of solid butter, so I hope this will make it easier in the future. I decided on the 3 most commonly used units, which are cups, grams, and ounces. I decided to create a program that would allow me to convert between the three. The ingredients I chose to convert in this project are the most common ingredients in baking, which will make it easy to get a rough estimate of weight in any future baking ventures. I created separate functions for each ingredient, then created a function that would check the ingredient so that the corresponding function would run. Since baking also requires changing of portion sizes sometimes, I also created a class that will allow me adjust servings according to what ingredient I put into the convertor if I wanted to. "
